# List of repositories consuming, or wishing to consume, boilerplate
# conventions.
#
# Note:
# - This file is currently maintained by hand (not by tooling). It's
#   YAML so it can used by tooling in the future.
# - At the time of this writing, there is only one convention:
#   openshift/golang-osd-operator.
# - At the time of this writing, the subscribers[].conventions[].status
#   "automated" isn't a thing yet.
#
# Pseudo-schema:
#   subscribers: List of dicts, each representing the state of a
#                repository subscribing, or wishing to subscribe, to one
#                or more boilerplate conventions.
#     - name: The org/name of the consuming repository.
#       conventions: List of conventions and the state of this
#                    repository's subscription.
#         - name: The name of the convention.
#           status: One of:
#                   "candidate": We expect this repository to subscribe
#                       to boilerplate eventually, but nothing has been
#                       done yet.
#                   "proposed": At least one PR is proposed to onboard
#                       the convention, but none have merged.
#                   "manual": The repository has merged one or more
#                       PRs subscribing to the convention. However,
#                       updates must still be performed manually.
#                   "automated": Tooling automatically proposes changes
#                       to the repository when changes to the subscribed
#                       convention and/or boilerplate framework merge.
